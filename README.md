# Hotel Booking Analytics Pipeline using Snowflake & Power BI

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics pipeline built using Snowflake for data processing and Power BI for visualization. The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world data engineering workflow using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) and create business-ready dashboards.

## Project Overview

Raw hotel booking data was ingested into Snowflake, cleaned and transformed using SQL, and then aggregated into analytical tables. These Gold-layer tables were finally connected to Power BI to create an interactive dashboard showing key business metrics.

## Architecture Used: Medallion Pattern:

1.  **Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion):**
    *   Raw CSV loaded into Snowflake using File Formats, Internal Stages, COPY INTO.
    *   No transformations applied.
    *   All columns stored as STRING.

2.  **Silver Layer (Cleaned & Standardized):**  Data cleaning and transformation logic
    *   Trimmed and standardized text fields
    *   Fixed invalid or missing emails
    *   Converted string dates to DATE format
    *   Removed invalid date ranges
    *   Converted numeric fields to proper types
    *   Corrected typos in booking status
    *   Removed negative values from revenue

4.  **Gold Layer (Analytics & KPIs):**  Aggregated tables created for analytics and dashboards
    *   Daily Booking Revenue
    *   Revenue by City
    *   Monthly Revenue & Bookings
    *   Bookings by Status
    *   Bookings by Room Type
    *   These tables are optimized for BI tools and business consumption.

## Dashboard (Power BI): 
The Gold tables were connected to Power BI to create a fully interactive dashboard.
KPIs Included:
*   Total Revenue
*   Total Bookings
*   Revenue by City (Top 10)
*   Monthly Booking Trends
*   Room Type Distribution
*   Bookings by Status
